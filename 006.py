# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
# 1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385
#
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
# (1+2+...+10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
# 3025âˆ’385=2640.
#
# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
