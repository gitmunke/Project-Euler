# Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly
# 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
#
# How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

import itertools

#r = str(0)
#d = str(1)

#moves = [r, r, r, r, r, r, r, r, r, r, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d, d]
#perm = itertools.permutations(moves)

#for i in set(perm):
#    print(i)

#got answer with a combination calculator, my computer couldnt handle it
